## Installation Instructions
### Requirements
To run the file, you will need to be running a Unix based OS, either MacOS or a Linux Distribution.
You will also need to have bash fully installed to be run by the terminal. Zsh and Fish do not work currently.
Finally, you will need to install the required modules in the requirements.txt document.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Program
The easiest method to run the program is to run make in the directory where the main file is located. 
```
$ make
```
Once the requirements have been completely fulfilled, this command should run with no issue as long as you are in the directory of the Makefile.
